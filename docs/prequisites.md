# Prerequisites
## Golang
You will need to install the latest version of Golang. You can get instructions for that at their offical site here: https://golang.org/doc/install

## Python
You will need at least python3 installed. This is used for docker-compose and also running the stress test script.

## Docker and docker-compose
### Windows
Here is the offical documentation for Docker: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ 
Here is the offical documentation for docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Linux
Here is the offical documentation for Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
Here is the offical documentation for docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

As Linux is much easier here is a quick way to install it:

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
pip3 install docker-compose
```
